- Encryption


2. What is Ark
- DPOS


3. what is IoT
- Define IoT


- Computing Power

| year | name | cpu | ram | extras | price |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| 1974 | MITS Altair 8800 | 2 MHz | 256 bytes to 64K | | $439<br>$621 asbl |
| 2012 | Raspberry Pi/ZeroW | Quad Core 1.2GHz/1GH | 1gb/512MB | 802.11 b/g/n - BLE | $35/$10/($5)
| 2014 | ESP8266 | 80 MHz (default) or 160 MHz | 64 KiB instruction 96 KiB data | 802.11 b/g/n | $3 / $10-$15 |
| 2016 | ESP32 | 160 or 240 MHz | 520 KiB SRAM | 802.11 b/g/n/e/i - BLE w/routing | $8/ $15-$20 |

Quicker, leaner, more efficient, more open.
